					Anwar Al-Hussain is the first visual media in English based in US, and broadcasts via cable, internet, and mobile. We aim to present the Shi'a ideology and teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his progeny. The ultimate goal is to have the audience understand the values of Imam Hussain (A.S.) and the reasons Imam Hussain (A.S.) was martyred.

					</header>
					<p>Anwar al-Hussain TV strives to educate both Muslims and non-Muslims about the true Message of Islam and to eradicate all misconceptions about Islam and Muslims. We seek to accomplish this by presenting Islam from the two divinely protected sources, the Holy Qur'an and the Pure Ahlul Bayte of Prophet Mohammed (s). Our aim is to also bring guidance to young Muslims on how to live Islam in West and integrate into Western society without compromising our Islamic morals and values. We chose television as our means to propagate our message because TV is seen all around the world and our youth should be watching programs that will give them a proper education about their Muslim faith.</p>
